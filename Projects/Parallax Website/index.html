        This landscape of “mountains” and “valleys” speckled with glittering
        stars is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region
        called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Captured in infrared light by
        NASA’s new James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals for the first
        time previously invisible areas of star birth. Called the Cosmic Cliffs,
        Webb’s seemingly three-dimensional picture looks like craggy mountains
        on a moonlit evening. In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous
        cavity within NGC 3324, and the tallest “peaks” in this image are about
        7 light-years high. The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula
        by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely
        massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the
        area shown in this image.

      <h2 class="sectionHead">Stephan's Quintet</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent">
        Stephan’s Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies, is best known for
        being prominently featured in the holiday classic film, “It’s a
        Wonderful Life.” Today, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope reveals
        Stephan’s Quintet in a new light. This enormous mosaic is Webb’s largest
        image to date, covering about one-fifth of the Moon’s diameter. It
        contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000
        separate image files. The information from Webb provides new insights
        into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the
        early universe. With its powerful, infrared vision and extremely high
        spatial resolution, Webb shows never-before-seen details in this galaxy
        group. Sparkling clusters of millions of young stars and starburst
        regions of fresh star birth grace the image. Sweeping tails of gas, dust
        and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies due to
        gravitational interactions. Most dramatically, Webb captures huge shock
        waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashes through the cluster.

      <p class="sectionContent">
        Some stars save the best for last. The dimmer star at the center of this
        scene has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years
        in all directions, and NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has revealed
        for the first time that this star is cloaked in dust. Two cameras aboard
        Webb captured the latest image of this planetary nebula, cataloged as
        NGC 3132, and known informally as the Southern Ring Nebula. It is
        approximately 2,500 light-years away. Webb will allow astronomers to dig
        into many more specifics about planetary nebulae like this one – clouds
        of gas and dust expelled by dying stars. Understanding which molecules
        are present, and where they lie throughout the shells of gas and dust
        will help researchers refine their knowledge of these objects.

        <p class="sectionContent">
            NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. Known as Webb’s First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.
            Thousands of galaxies – including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared – have appeared in Webb’s view for the first time. This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground.
